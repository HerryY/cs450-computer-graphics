I imagine that you'll probably get a dozen or so of these, but it's something that I want to do!
The project would basically be implementing a basic version of the video game Minecraft that includes:
- A 3D world filled with textured blocks that is automatically generated
- At least 5 block types, including:
    - At least one non-cube block
    - At least one block that emits light
    - At least one block with different textures on each side
    - At least one block that is partially transparent
- Lighting, including from the sun and from light blocks
- At least one animal model (with animation and motion)
- A player that is controlled by the user to move around and look at the world
- The ability to place and destroy blocks
- A third-person view for the player
- A first-person view for the player that shows the player's hand, plus animation
